We will use GeoScape buildings in ESRI ShapeFile provided by NEMA which are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NH5Pu71jBxmchTKSeYyj7VF26WXLvowN?usp=share_link) (access restricted to NEMA peronell). Download the shapefiles to a local folder (e.g., [../resources/buildings](../resources/buildings) or [../flood-activations](../flood-activations)) and unzip the files.\n",
